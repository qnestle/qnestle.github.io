<p> -I also really like memes.</p>
  <body> But that's not all. I'm an athlete, student first though. I weightliftight amoung other things. I also can be a bit of a nerd at times.</body><br>  
  <br>
   <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>
  <p> One of my favorite websites is Wikipedia. For more than its's source of knowledge. Actually it's because of its knowledge that i am here. Without wikipedia i would havde had a semi-difficult time with school.</p><br>
   <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com">Dailymotion</a>
   <p>As i said, i am a huge nerd and part of being the nerd i am is watching anime. *sigh* I have been watching these kinda shows since i was a we lad and i have watched hundreds if not somewhere between 1 to 2 thousand hours of shows and such. And i have no REGERTS.</p><br>
   <a href="https://www.memecenter.com"> MemEcENteR</a>
   <p> I like memes. I wish that was nuff said, but some just don't understand the positive effect that they had on humanity and myself personally. They have made people cry and laugh. Not to mention  how they help one express their views on a topic. But i mostly like theme because of the "lulz" they provide.</p><br>
